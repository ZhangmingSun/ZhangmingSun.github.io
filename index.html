<a id="Internship Experience" class="anchor" href="#Internship Experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internship</h3>
<p><b>Cloud Network Solution Intern(2016.5~2016.8) at Futurewei Technologies, Inc., Plano, Texas</b><br>
I mainly worked on OpenCORD which is consisted of OpenStack, ONOS and XOS. And I also need to be familiar with Docker Container, Nova-Docker, OpenSwitch, OpenFlow.

<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience</h3>
<p>
<b>(1) SQL Programming In Library Management System Project(2016)</b><br>
I implemented complex library database schema which contains 8 tables. It has many functions like Book Search, Checking Out/In, Borrower Account Management, Fines Management, etc. It needs many SQL skills and took me a lot of time to finish it.<br>
Skill Set: SQL, JDBC, MySQL, Database Schema Design, Java Swing(GUI), Java<br><br>

<b>(2) Hadoop Big Data Processing Experience (2016)</b><br>
I respectively using MapReduce and Scala/Spark to program and to analyze social network data, like to find common friend list and to find Top N bi-gram words from a document.<br><br>

<b>(3) Spark MLlib, Spark Streaming, Kafka Experience (2016)</b><br>
Using spark MLlib, I use kmeans to cluster the movies using the ratings, and use decision tree and Naive Bayes to classify data. I use collaborative filtering to find the accuracy of ALS model. I use Spark Streaming framework with Kafka to find Top N bi-gram words.<br><br>

<b>(4) OS Projects Experience(2015)</b><br>
These are three projects. The project 1 is Task Executor which maintains a pool of threads that executes many tasks provided by the clients. The project 2 is to construct a client-server system that communicates over TCP/IP sockets. The project 3 is Batch File Processor which is to build a tool that parses XML files and executes commands in it.<br><br>

<b>(5) Java Programming for Machine learning Application (2016)</b><br>
In Machine Learning Homework, first, I used the java to implement the ID3 Algorithm and post pruning algorithm which can generate a decision tree. Second, I programed to implement Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for text classification. Third, I used BP Neural Network to build a Character Recognition System. Forth, I also used  PCA, SVM, KNN, etc.<br><br>

<b>(6) Mobile App and Web Programming (2015)</b><br>
I learned Android by myself. I originally use eclipse to do Android development. Now is Android Studio. So I know Android mechanism, like Activity, Service, intent, Content Provider, etc. For another, I once built a website. I used "HTML, Javascript, JQuery CSS, AJAX" to do Front-End Development, and used "PHP, MySQL" to do Back-End Development.<br><br>

<b>(7) Building a Rudimentary Database Engine (2016)</b><br>
I use java to design and implement a rudimentary database engine. It can parse and run the basic SQL commands. It can deal with the case of errors. Furthermore, both table data and index data are stored in disk in binary format. It is challenging.<br><br>

<b>(8) Image Processing and Computer Vision (2014)</b><br>
I once participated in an industry program to detect the unqualified bottles by image processing. Second, I also once built a face recognition system based on PCA and SVM.<br><br>
