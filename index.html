<a id="Internship Experience" class="anchor" href="#Internship Experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internship</h3>
<p><b>Cloud Network Solution Intern(2016.5~2016.8) at Futurewei Technologies, Inc., Plano, Texas</b><br>
I mainly worked on OpenCORD which is consisted of OpenStack, ONOS and XOS. And I also need to be familiar with Docker Container, Nova-Docker, OpenSwitch, OpenFlow.

<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience</h3>
<p>
<b>(1) SQL Programming In Library Management System Project(2016)</b><br>
I implemented complex library database schema which contains 8 tables. It has many functions like Book Search, Checking Out/In, Borrower Account Management, Fines Management, etc. It needs many SQL skills and took me a lot of time to finish it.<br>
Skill Set: SQL, JDBC, MySQL, Database Schema Design, Java Swing(GUI), Java<br><br>
<b>(2) Java Programming Machine learning Application (2015)</b><br>
In the Machine Learning, First, I used the java to implement the ID3 Algorithm and post pruning algorithm, which can generate a decision tree. I also used the training set, the validation set and the test set during this process. Second, I programed to implement respectively Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for text classification and evaluate them. Third, I am now using java and Back-Propagation Neural Network to build a Digital Character Recognition System. Forth, I am also familiar with PCA, SVM, KNN, etc.<br><br>
<b>(3) Java Experience in OS Projects (2015)</b><br>
These are three projects. The project 1 is Task Executor which maintains a pool of threads that executes many tasks provided by the clients. The project 2 is to construct a client-server system that communicates over TCP/IP sockets. The project 3 is Batch File Processor which is to build a tool that parses XML files and executes commands in it.<br><br>
<b>(4) Docker Container, ONOS and OpenCORD (2016)</b><br>
During the internship period in Futurewei Technologies, Inc., I mainly worked on OpenCORD and build its environment. I also need to run docker container under OpenStack and be familiar with its commands. I also need to use ONOS, and run app on it. For example, we can use it to load flow rules to CPqD(OFSoftswitch 1.3).<br><br>
<b>(5) Mobile App and Web Programming (2015)</b><br>
I learned Android by myself. I originally use eclipse to do Android development. Now is Android Studio. So I know Android mechanism, like Activity, Service, intent, Content Provider, etc. For another, I once built a website. I used "HTML, Javascript, CSS, AJAX" to do Front-End Development, and used "PHP, MySQL" to do Back-End Development.<br><br>
<b>(6) Building a Rudimentary Database Engine (2015)</b><br>
I use java to design and implement a rudimentary database engine. It can parse and run the basic SQL commands. It can deal with the case of errors. Furthermore, both table data and index data are stored in disk in binary format. It is challenging.<br><br>
