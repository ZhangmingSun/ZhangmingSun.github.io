<p><b>Cloud Network Solution Intern(2016.5~2016.8) at Futurewei Technologies, Inc., Plano, Texas</b><br>
I mainly worked on OpenCORD which is consisted of OpenStack, ONOS and XOS. And I also need to be familiar with Docker Container, Nova-Docker, OpenSwitch, OpenFlow.
</p>
<p><b>Android Development(2015.3~2015.7) in CIeNET Technologies, China</b><br>
I took part in developing and testing the Android System of vehicle-mounted system.
</p>
<p><b>Robotic Software Development(2011.10~2012.7) in LiRen Robotic Limited Company, China</b><br>
I designed and developed the 1st version of software in Industrial Robot Controller in the Company.

<a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience</h3>
<p>
<b>(1) Android eBookApp with Volley, Google App Engine, RESTful(Jersey), MySQL(on Cloud) (2016)</b><br>
I first built an eBookApp on Android which used Volley to send HttpRequest and parsed JSON data received from server. Then I deployed the Jersey RESTful framework on Google App Engine(Cloud), which is to read eBook data from MySQL on Cloud and then send data to Android App in JSON format.<br><br>

<b>(2) Hadoop(MapReduce), Spark(MLlib, Streaming, SQL) and Kafka Experience (2016)</b><br>
I respectively using MapReduce and Spark to program and to analyze social network data. I also used Spark Mllib(like kmeans, decision tree, Naive Bayes, ALS model) to finish some tasks. I use Spark Streaming framework with Kafka to find Top N bi-gram words real time.<br><br>

<b>(3) OS Projects Experience(2015)</b><br>
These are three projects. The project 1 is Task Executor which maintains a pool of threads that executes many tasks provided by the clients. The project 2 is to construct a client-server system that communicates over TCP/IP sockets. The project 3 is Batch File Processor which is to build a tool that parses XML files and executes commands in it.<br><br>

<b>(4) Java Programming for Machine learning Application (2015)</b><br>
In Machine Learning Homework, first, I used the java to implement the ID3 Algorithm and post pruning algorithm which can generate a decision tree. Second, I programed to implement Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for text classification. Third, I used BP Neural Network to build a Character Recognition System. Forth, I also used  PCA, SVM, KNN, etc.<br><br>

<b>(5) Docker Container, ONOS and OpenCORD (2016)</b><br>
During the internship period in Futurewei Technologies, Inc., I mainly worked on OpenCORD and build its environment. I also need to run docker container under OpenStack and be familiar with its commands. I also need to use ONOS, and run app on it. For example, we can use it to load flow rules to CPqD(OFSoftswitch 1.3).<br><br>

<b>(6) Library Management System with Java and SQL Programming(2016)</b><br>
I implemented complex library database schema which contains 8 tables. It has many functions like Book Search, Checking Out/In, Borrower Account Management, Fines Management, etc. It needs many SQL skills and took me a lot of time to finish it.<br>
Skill Set: SQL, JDBC, MySQL, Database Schema Design, Java Swing(GUI), Java<br><br>

<b>(7) Building a Rudimentary Database Engine (2015)</b><br>
I use java to design and implement a rudimentary database engine. It can parse and run the basic SQL commands. It can deal with the case of errors. Furthermore, both table data and index data are stored in disk in binary format. It is challenging.<br><br>

<b>(8) Image Processing and Computer Vision (2014)</b><br>
I once participated in an industry program to detect the unqualified bottles by image processing. Second, I also once built a face recognition system based on PCA and SVM.<br><br>

<b>(9) Web Programming Experience (2016)</b><br>
In Web Programming class, we used two servers to build a book bidding website, and use Jersey RESTful Web Services framework, and use technology like session, SSL/TLS, compression(gzip), Memchached, MySQL, etc. I also learned skills like HTML/CSS/Javascript, JQuery, Servlet/JSP, JDBC.<br><br>
